## Deployment
The project is deployed to this link <https://github.com/Iacopo454/Body-Fashion>.
In order to make the project live on the internet, first I have checked that I used all the Git commands: git-status,git-add, git-commit, git push to create the relevant repositories on Github.  
After this, from the GitHub page <https://www.https://github.com/Iacopo454/Body-Fashion> I clicked at the top right of the page on "Settings" link, then I scroll down to the GitHub Pages section that is designed to host our project pages from the GitHub repositories, and selected the "Master branch" in my case as it is what I been provided from Code Institute for this project, but the project may have many branches to choose, then I been provided with a link that might take few minutes to be active and when it is our site is published at that link. 

## Technologies used
* HTML5 and CSS
* Bootstrap 4.2.1 
I used it for the top collapsable Navigation-bar, the grid system to make the pages responsive on different screen sizes for better user visualization experience, documentations such as cards, a carousel code to display the images in slide function, jumbotron to hold an image, a week Timetable to display the training classes time. Here the link <https://getbootstrap.com/>.
* Fontawesome v5.0.10
Font and icon kit toolkit based on CSS and LESS, incorporated into the BootstrapCDN. I used it for the social footer icons: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Pinterest and Linkdin.
Here the link <https://fontawesome.com/v5.10.0/icons?d=gallery>.
* Gitpod 
I used it as editor to create my code.
* Git/GitHub platform for the deployment
Keep the project in repositories with frequent commits and informative messages.
* Google Chrome Dev Tool 
I have used this technology to Edit my HTML and CSS code.
* Balsamiq Wireframes 
I have used this software to create the wireframe and so my first project ideas.
* Jquery 
I have copy and pasted his link from Bootstrap to the bottom of my page, It helps to develop most browser compatible web page.
